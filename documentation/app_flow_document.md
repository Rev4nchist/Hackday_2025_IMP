# HackDay 2025 Idea Management Portal App Flow Document

## Introduction

This document describes the comprehensive flow for the HackDay 2025 Idea Management Portal, a web-based platform built around showcasing and managing pre-submitted project ideas. The main goal of the application is to allow team members, organizers, and staff investors to easily browse, explore, and engage with project ideas while also providing HackDay organizers with the tools to review and manage these ideas. The portal integrates an external CSV data source for idea imports and uses a modern UI template inspired by TaskIn to offer a visually engaging, responsive user experience. Every step of the user journey, from initial access to future integrations, is explained in simple language to ensure clarity and consistency.

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

New users begin their experience at a clean, engaging landing page that introduces the purpose and key features of the portal. For a new visitor, the first step is to register or sign in using the company authentication system that leverages Microsoft Azure SSO or OAuth. Users are prompted to log in with their company credentials, and detailed instructions are provided to guide them through the secure authentication process. If a user forgets their password, a clearly marked option allows them to recover their account using their email. Once the registration or sign in is completed, the system automatically assigns roles based on the company credentials, directing users to the appropriate dashboard view.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After signing in, users are taken to the main dashboard, which serves as the central hub of the platform. The dashboard showcases a dynamic list of pre-submitted ideas presented in visually appealing cards. Key information such as project title, a short description, category, submission date, and live watch counts are clearly visible. There is a navigation header along with menu options that prompt users to explore ideas, access the HackDay information hub, or delve deeper into a project detail page. The interface uses a familiar layout with responsive design so that users on desktops, tablets, or mobile devices receive a consistent and engaging experience. From the dashboard, users can easily navigate to search and filtering functions, view exciting trending projects, or explore special curated sections such as Staff Picks.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

Once a user selects an idea from the main listing, they are transitioned to a detailed idea page that provides comprehensive project information. On this page, the full description of the project is displayed, including impact areas, team size preferences, and necessary skills, alongside contact information for team formation. Interactive elements such as the animated watch button and three distinct reaction buttons labeled ‚Äúüî• Hot Idea!‚Äù, ‚Äúüí° Interesting!‚Äù, and ‚Äúü§î Tell me more!‚Äù are featured prominently. These reaction buttons are animated and provide fun visual feedback, allowing users to express their enthusiasm and signal support for the idea. The detailed view page also shows updated watch counts in real time and allows users to navigate back to the idea listing or to other sections, ensuring a seamless connection between pages. In parallel, for users interested in joining a project, the roadmap is simple: view the detailed project information and then use the contact details provided to reach out directly outside of the portal.

The administrator flow represents another core aspect of the detailed feature journey. Organizers and designated admin users access a secure admin panel through a separate authentication gateway. After logging in, admin users are presented with a dashboard where they can import ideas via CSV file uploads. The process is streamlined: once the CSV file is uploaded, the system processes the data and populates the idea listing with entries marked as pre-submitted. Admin users can then review each idea, approving or rejecting them, and make any necessary edits. In addition, the admin panel provides access to category management, basic analytics showing idea counts and trending projects, and controls to manage the overall idea pipeline. Navigation within the admin panel is designed to allow easy switching between the import functionality, idea management sections, and analytics dashboards.

For future enhancements, a dedicated flow will be implemented to connect this core functionality with a live investment dashboard during Demo Day. The architecture is built to support real-time voting and investment credit features for both ELT/SLT and other staff, ensuring that the current data structures and flows can be extended without disrupting the existing user experience.

## Settings and Account Management

Users can manage their personal settings and account details through a dedicated account settings page that is reachable via the main navigation header. Here, users are able to update or view their profile information, change notification preferences, and manage their login credentials. Although billing and subscription settings are not critical for the MVP, the flow provides clear accessibility options for any future expansion in that area. Once users adjust their settings, simple navigation options allow them to return to the main dashboard or any other page in the portal without losing context of their current work or interactions.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

Throughout the entire portal, error states and alternate paths are clearly defined. Whenever a user inputs invalid data or encounters issues with connectivity, friendly and descriptive error messages appear on the screen, notifying the user of the problem and suggesting actionable steps. For instance, during login or registration, incorrect credentials trigger clear error notices with options to retry or reset passwords. If an admin attempts to upload a CSV file that is improperly formatted, the system provides feedback on which fields are missing or incorrect, ensuring that data import remains robust. In cases where a user attempts to access a restricted section without proper authentication or authorization, the system redirects them to a secure log-in page with a message explaining the access limitation. Throughout these scenarios, fallback pages and clear error directives ensure that users are always guided back to a normal flow.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

The HackDay 2025 Idea Management Portal provides a streamlined and engaging journey for all its users. From the initial sign-up with Microsoft Azure-based authentication to browsing and interacting with pre-submitted ideas, every page is connected seamlessly. Team members can explore detailed project information and express interest using interactive reaction buttons and watch features. HackDay organizers have robust tools through the admin panel to import, review, and manage ideas with ease. All settings and error handling components are incorporated to ensure a smooth user experience. The application‚Äôs design not only supports the current MVP requirements but also sets the stage for future enhancements such as a live investment dashboard during Demo Day, making the overall journey intuitive, secure, and scalable for future innovations.
